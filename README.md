The [Flash Study app](https://flash-learning.onrender.com) is meant as an easy way to study any topic for free, by uploading a simple Excel Sheet with questions and answers.

The app is built in [Python Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) and building it had a dual purpose for me personally:
1. Gaining more experience in Plotly Dash
2. Using the app to hopefully get my sailing license

Deployment is done through [Render](https://render.com/), with the help of [Dash Tools](https://dash-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Enjoy this simple app and please leave any suggestions.
